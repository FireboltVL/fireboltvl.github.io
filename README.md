# Firebolt-VL

**Efficient Vision-Language Understanding with Cross-Modality Modulation**

Firebolt-VL is a novel vision-language model designed for fast multimodal reasoning and fine-grained visual grounding. By replacing heavy cross-attention fusion with a lightweight Cross-modal Modulator (CMM) and state-space modeling, it achieves high performance on consumer-grade hardware.

## Key Features

*   **⚡ Efficient Inference**: Leverages State-Space Models (SSM) and CMM for fast generation.
*   **🎯 Fine-grained Grounding**: Computes token–grid correlations to align text tokens with relevant visual regions.
*   **🧩 Cross-modality Modulation**: Uses Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to inject visual signals into text features efficiently.
